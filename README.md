Apache-Mahout-cookbook
======================
This is the first revision of the Apache Mahout cookbook (http://bit.ly/KmwfX3).<br>
Due to some bugs I decided to re-up on Github the whole code. <br>
The original code has 10 chapters and for every one of them there was a separate Maven project. <br>
In this realease I decide to have one whole Maven projetc where every chapter is separatated into a different package.<br>
The code use Mahout 0.8 ad dependency and the dependency is mapped on a local jar. <br>
However you could change the dependency to the online one so to avoid having to compile the Mahout framework on you local environment. <br>
The code have been tested using NetBeans 7.4, into a single Linux MInt 16 Virtual Machine.<br>
